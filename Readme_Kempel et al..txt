Data and code from Kempel et al. 2020 Conservation Letters.
8024 populations of 713 plant species were revisited throughout Switzerland and the presence or absence of each target species was assessed.

Legend

IUCNorder: IUCN threat category, ordered by threat
Fn, Tn, Kn, Rn, Nn, Ln: Landolt indicator value, as numeric (for plotting Fig S2)
Rnum, Cnum: Ruderal and competitive strategy, numeric
yeardif: Difference in years between the start of the revisitation project and the last record of a population
xy_coded: XY coordinates are coded, because we are not allowed to publish coordinates of the threatened species.
